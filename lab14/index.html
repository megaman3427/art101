                <h2>Debugging</h2>
                <p>I reviewed the lecture talking about the Lab 13 and worked along with the recording. I rewrote the js file and tested it through replit tp see if everyhting worked. I then noticed that it still wasnt working after commiting to github. I saw that i was missing the output line and the script line in the html. After adding them everything then began to work.  </p>
